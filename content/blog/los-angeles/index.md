In LA, there is definitely a sense of multi-culturalism and you can find food at any price range of any cuisine. Remember that LA is a sprawling city and it's hard to know every part of LA in a short period of time. All across LA, for good and cheap food. go to that small Mexican restaurant in the corner without any flashy signs. Many of them don't have Yelp reviews but if they have Spanish speaking people, you know it's good.

Here are some of my favorites in particular areas. I have a preference for family-owned, affordable places, that are good value but albeit good food that are extremely worthwhile.

Food trucks are pretty LA. Make sure you try some taco truck. There are more well known ones like Kogi but you'll be fine with most.

#### Downtown
* Grand Central Market - similar to Chelsea market in New York. There is a hodgepodge collection of nice, cultural foods here. Nothing is crazy experience and you can find nice El Salvadoran or Mexican food. Eggslut is also well known but the line is crazy line.
* Little Tokyo - just take a look on Yelp and all the top restaurants are pretty good ramen/sushi places. Expect a long line on nights because the restaurants are small.
* Langer's - best pastrami sandwiches in LA. Good breakfast time where there aren't many lines
* A lot of good coffee shops. Phil's, Tilt's Coffee Bar.
* Guisado's is amazing Mexican food. Every bit Mexican and great food that is extremely well priced.
* Olvera Street is a nice little, albeit, touristy Mexican street with a lot of good restaurants.

#### Silver Lake
* Pine and Crane - excellent Western taste on Taiwanese foods. Authentic, but prepared with better fashion


#### Koreatown
* Easy, hole in the wall Korean restaurants.
* The popular ones are great as well (refer to Yelp or TripAdvisor), just might have to wait a while and they're a bit more pricy. Not crazy expensive for LA though.
* Mexican food
* El Salvadoran and Guatemalan food
* Any Korean specialty dish, there will be a restaurant that is dedicated to that. e.g. Soondae, Bossam, Japchae
* La Guelaguetza is really good. Oaxacan (region of Mexico) food, a lot of foodies go there as well as Mexican people.
* Korean Fried Chicken

#### Hollywood
* Little Armenia. Try Carousel
* Thai Town - really good and cheap
* Expensive European and American frivolous bars and restaurants.

#### Alhambra/San Gabriel/El Monte
Authentic Chinese and Vietnamese food. There isn't much else to do here besides eat. Expensive and high quality Boba places.

#### Sawtelle
A lot of nice Japanese food without the foot traffic. Pretty authentic. Good Boba as well. Westwood has Saffron and Rose, really good Persian ice cream. Also, other really nice Persian restaurants.

#### Glendale
Too far for me without a car but a lot of amazing food so I hear.
* Good Armenian.

#### South LA
Revolutionario - a lot of North African (Morrocan) tacos.

#### Little Ethiopia
Cheap and filling foods that are small vegetable or meat curries

#### Filipino Food
Near Hollywood and Koreatown, there is filipino town. A lot of local markets sell traditional Filipino food

#### Arts District
* Many trendy restaurants and great public art.
* Angel City brewery is well known and always buzzing with people.
* A lot of different trendy coffee shops
